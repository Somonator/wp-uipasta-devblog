# Ui Pasta Dev Blog
Beatiful theme for simple blog web developers.

# Note
The theme was adapted by me for WordPress. Some elements have been redone, but all main elements of layout is save. Added new ones with designs in my opinion. 

# Gutenberg is disable
Why? Because this is a simple blog, not a landing page.
